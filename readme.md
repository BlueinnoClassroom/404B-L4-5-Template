## Instructions

### Split VS Code Window

You can drag `main.py` tab to the right side of the window to split the window into two panes. This will allow you to see the instructions and the code at the same time.

### Answering

You can answer the questions by writing your answers in the `main.py` file.

You can run the code by clicking the `Run` button on the top right corner of the editor.

The output will be shown in the `Terminal` tab at the bottom of the editor.

## Your Task

Complete the function `count(...)` in `main.py` which accepts a list of integers, count the occurrence of each item in the list, return the a dictionary which keys are the items in the list while the values are the occurrences.

Sample:

```python
# ✅ Complete this function, replace `pass` with your solution:
def count(numbers) -> dict:
    pass





    

# ❌ Do NOT change these lines:
list1 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
list2 = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 99]

count1 = count(list1)
count2 = count(list2)

print(count1)  # --> {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 5: 5}
print(count2)  # --> {-1: 8, 0: 3, 99: 1}
